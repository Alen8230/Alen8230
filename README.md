Determine Significance Level: Divide the desired significance level (usually 0.05) by the number of pairwise comparisons (10 in this case) to obtain the adjusted significance level for each comparison.

Adjusted Significance Level (( \alpha_{adj} )) = ( \frac{\alpha}{\text{Number of Comparisons}} )

Perform Pairwise Comparisons: Compare each pair of groups using a t-test (or another appropriate test) and the adjusted significance level obtained in step 1.

Given your data, here's a step-by-step breakdown of how you can apply the Bonferroni correction:

Adjusted Significance Level:
[ \alpha_{adj} = \frac{0.05}{10} = 0.005 ]
